# ucExplorer


ucExplorer is now entering alpha testing. The initial feature set is complete, and it's loading to the correct startup path, and the implemented interfaces are being called without raising errors in their default state. The selection changed events are successfully listing files, and the navigation event is successfully reporting new paths. There's a lot of features still to test.
